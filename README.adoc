# Ditto FixDB

Tooling to save as match as possible from a broken ditto sqlite DB.

## how it works

. read only on life DB
. write only on new target DB -- must not be the same
. each table is copied chunk-wise. If a chuck fails, it's broken into smaller chunks.
.. This is done recursively (ie like binary search)
.. the target DB contains a table to remember chucks and state
. cleanup
..  If FKs are broken, then all dangling records are removed
